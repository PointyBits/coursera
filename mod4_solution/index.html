<!--
    Summary: In this assignment, you are going to loop over an array of names 
    and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. 
    If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. 
    If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.

However, in order to do that printing you will have to use 2 externally provided 
libraries whose code is not 100% ready to be used. Using the things we've learned 
in this module, your job will be to fix the code in those libraries.

<!-- 
    script.js is basically already written for us in Easy Mode
    IIFE wrapping the other two scripts
    exposing the functions globally to "window"
